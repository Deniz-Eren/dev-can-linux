 * \file    linux/types.h
 * \brief   Redirects inclusion to project types instead.
 *
 * \details This file has the exact same name and path as the one supplied by
 *          the Linux Kernel source-code, however the contents have been
 *          completely replaced. This has been done to keep the rest of the
 *          Linux Kernel source-code unchanged so that ongoing updates to the
 *          Linux Kernel can be propagated to this project easily.
